          The Bureau of Labor Statistics defined location quotient as “the ratio
          of the area concentration of occupational employment to the national
          average concentration”. Essentially, a location quotient greater than
          one indicates the occupation has a higher share of employment than
          average, and a location quotient less than one indicates the
          occupation is less common in the area than average.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Theoretically, industries with a higher occupational employment should
          offer lower annual mean wages given competition and industries with a
          lower occupational employment should offer higher annual mean wages.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The highest annual mean wage of $250, 000 belongs to “chief
          executives”, which have a low location quotient of 0.5.

          This is a scatterplot of the correlation between location quotient and
          annual mean wage of occupations in New York City, Newark and Jersey
          City.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “Shampooers” have the lowest mean annual wage, close to $25, 000 and a
          location quotient of 2.4.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Jobs like “advertising and promotions managers” have a very high
          location quotient, between 4.5 and 5, and very high annual mean wages,
          close to $200, 000. Ideally, this makes “advertising and promotions
          managers” the likeliest career to pursue in New York City, Newark and
          Jersey City.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Similarly, “law teachers, post-secondary” and “financial examiners”
          also have high annual mean wages and location quotients, making them
          ideal careers to pursue in these cities.
